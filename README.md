## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a data enthusiast transitioning from healthcare to data analytics. With a solid foundation in healthcare from my role as a Nursing Assistant and Master's Degree level training in Physician Associate Studies, I am currently completing a comprehensive 9-week data analytics bootcamp at Le Wagon. My skills include data extraction, analysis, and visualization using tools like Google Analytics, BigQuery, and MySQL. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and make impactful decisions. Currently seeking full-time remote roles in Data Science where I can apply my analytical skills and healthcare experience. Feel free to connect with me or explore my projects!
